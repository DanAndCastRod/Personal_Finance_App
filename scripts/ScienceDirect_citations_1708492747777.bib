abstract = {The DLR project ALLFlight (Assisted Low-Level Flight and Landing on Unprepared Landing Sites) deals with the development of a helicopter pilot assistance system, to provide pilot assistance during all phases of flight. The research is particularly focused on the landing on unprepared sites in the presence of obstacles and in a degraded visual environment. The goal is to compute a safe flight path in real time that is displayed to the pilot. Several technical components such as a sensor suite to scan the environment, path planning algorithms, head-down and helmet-mounted displays, active inceptors, and the model-based flight control system are set up to form the overall assistance system. Throughout the development, pilot surveys generate requirements to design individual components such as path planning algorithms, or the synthetic view of the helmet-mounted display. Prior surveys accelerate the design and adjustment of the respective components, meaning that the flight tests benefit from well-designed components, minimizing the requirement for further “re-designs”. During ALLFlight, the successfully flight-tested manual landing with path planning and obstacle avoidance in real time for an unknown terrain has been demonstrated. This paper describes each assistance component, the pilot surveys, and the results obtained in almost six years of research.}

abstract = {The growth of global ocean noise recorded over the past decades is increasingly affecting marine species and requires assessment on the part of marine managers. We present a framework for the analysis of species' exposure to noise from shipping. Integrated into a set of geovisualization tools, our approach focuses on exposure hotspot mapping, on the computation of probabilistic levels of exposure, and on the identification of shipping routes that minimize exposure levels for Cetacean species. The framework was applied to estimate noise exposure for the Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) population, and for the exploration of possible ship traffic displacement scenarios in the Salish Sea, British Columbia. Four noise exposure hotspots were identified within the SRKW's core habitat. Exposure over these areas was mainly produced by six vessel classes, namely Ferries, Tugboats, Recreational Vessels, Vehicle Carriers, Containers, and Bulkers. Exposure levels showed variability across hotspots suggesting that a fine-scale spatial dimension should be included in the design of noise pollution mitigation strategies for the Salish Sea. The scenarios suggest that small changes in the current shipping lanes (3.4% increase in traveled distance) can lead to a 56% reduction of the overlap between vessel traffic and sensitive areas for SRKW.}

The methodology implements, in a GIS tool, a linear cost model for pipeline construction considering local conditions that affect the pipeline cost. Multi-criteria analysis with those local factors, allows building cost surface maps representing the cost of a standardized diameter pipeline in any cell of the GIS model. The storage costs are assigned to the potential injection location and the resulting map is combined through map algebra with the transport cost surface. The CCS Province is defined using least cost path analysis to find for each cell in the GIS the lowest accumulative transport and storage cost and allocating to a given province all the cells that lead to the same storage site. The methodology is illustrated for the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco.}

This paper explores how essential economic development might be reconciled with the need to keep carbon emissions in check. We develop a geographically explicit framework and use spatial modeling and cost estimates from recent engineering studies to determine where stand-alone renewable energy generation is a cost effective alternative to centralized grid supply. Our results suggest that decentralized renewable energy will likely play an important role in expanding rural energy access. However, it will be the lowest cost option for a minority of households in Africa, even when likely cost reductions over the next 20 years are considered. Decentralized renewables are competitive mostly in remote and rural areas, while grid connected supply dominates denser areas where the majority of households reside. These findings underscore the need to decarbonize the fuel mix for centralized power generation as it expands in Africa.}

However, as the connection cost of a wave energy development is a driving factor in the development's feasibility, existing wind farm cable-routing techniques used by renewable energy developers may not be satisfactory. A Geographical Information System (GIS) method is presented which optimises the cable route between a wave farm and the electricity network, while taking a range of exclusion zones, such as native vegetation, into account. The optimisation is presented for a South Australian study area, which subsequently showed that exclusion zones reduce the number of suitable locations for wave energy by almost 40%. The method presented also assesses the effect that each exclusion zone applied has upon the number of suitable locations within the study area. The analysis undertaken showed that National Parks and cliffs pose a significant limitation to the potential of a wave energy industry within South Australia. Allowing the transmission route to travel through a National Park, or traverse a cliff, resulted in an increase in the number of locations from which a connection could be made to the electricity grid for less than $10 million of 33% and 50%, respectively. Conservation Parks, Wilderness Areas and native vegetation also have an effect upon the number of suitable locations for wave energy within South Australia. The GIS methods developed may be of assistance to governments in setting appropriate marine renewable energy policy, and also in identifying existing policy which may require amending if the government wishes to pursue and support the development of wave energy.}

The development of SIENA involved identifying and quantifying fundamental processes and similarities in urban areas in Great Britain and using those to guide the building of SIENA within a GIS. An internal validation confirmed SIENA's realism. Its generality, achieved through the pooling of information from different real-world cities, makes it particularly useful for developing and testing spatial epidemiological concepts and models; simulating processes and interactions relating to environmental exposure; and exploring theoretical and methodological problems in the spatial analysis of environmental health. SIENA ultimately provides a much needed tool in the form of a controlled, simplified urban simulation model.}

The results present the evolution of the climate change emission versus the operational costs of the power system up to 2050. The yearly electricity mix evaluations allow assessing the long-term development of the European energy system, where a focus is done on variable renewable energy production. It is shown that policy-only solutions, associated with a traditional cost-oriented optimisation, have a limited impact on helping the power sector to reach emission levels targets. Integrating the objective of reducing emissions to the management of power plants would reduce the absolute and cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The counterpart is that the system electricity price tends to increase faster thus implying increased social costs.}

This is based around the application of high resolution data and GIS models to map four attributes of wildness: perceived naturalness of land cover, absence of modern human artefacts in the landscape, rugged and challenging nature of the terrain, and remoteness from mechanised access. These are combined using multi-criteria evaluation and fuzzy methods to determine spatial patterns and variability in wild land quality. The approach is demonstrated and tested for the two national parks in Scotland: the Cairngorms National Park and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. This is presented within a wider debate on the ability of such models to accurately depict and spatially define the concept of wildness within both the Scottish setting and the wider global context. Conclusions are drawn as to scalability and transferability, together with potential future applications including local and national level mapping, and support for landscape character assessment, planning policy and development control. Maps of the wild land core, buffer and periphery areas of the two parks are presented.}

This chapter examines the ability of rural electric distribution cooperatives to continue operating in their present form in a restructured electricity market. More specifically, it develops and estimates a quadratic cost model, which, unlike many of the cost functions employed in studies of this nature, conforms to all of the properties of a proper cost function. Using 1996 data, it was discovered that these firms are not operating in a cost-minimizing fashion. This chapter sought to determine whether rural electric coops in the United States are efficient distributors of electricity. According to the results of the various efficiency measures employed, none of these firms is distributing anywhere near the cost minimizing number of megawatt-hours. This finding seems to occur because each is too small in terms of the quantity of electricity distributed. As a result, mergers between these firms could yield substantial savings and help ensure their survival in their present form in a deregulated market. In addition, the confirmation of economies of scope indicates that rather substantial cost savings would occur if these firms could increase the quantity of electricity distributed to industrial loads.}

The results show that when the range of stakeholders’ values and concerns are incorporated into the siting model, the conventional LCP between the source of electricity and the destination is not necessarily the best solution.

The currently models for rural electrification are often limited in their electrical analysis, or focus on a idealistic optimal solution whilst ignoring the real hierarchical topology of power systems. This work proposes a rural electrification strategy that makes use of Geographic Information System (GIS), graph theory and terrain analysis to create the best electric network topology. It uses the GIS for Electrification (GISEle) tool while improving the former topological-focused analysis, to one that considers other aspects of electric network planning such as cable sizing based on current-carrying capacity constraints and the sharing of substations connections. By considering these factors, a better and more realistic topology is achieved. Furthermore, an electrical analysis was performed to endorse the topology found, by executing load flow analysis in critical parts of the grid, in order to investigate steady-state voltages, as well as substation and line loading. The strategy proposed was applied to a real case study of grid expansion in the municipality of Cavalcante, in a rural area in Brazil. The goal is to find the most cost-efficient network topology reaching up to 100% of the local population through an expansion of the MV distribution network. The results show that by using the new approach proposed, a reduction of up to 47% (compared to a standard minimum spanning tree procedure) of the total investment cost in line deployment was achieved. This reduction is possible through a proper sizing, based on the power supplied, of the MV cables used in the electrification planning.}

At the same time, societal interest in reduced intensity management regimes is growing for a range of practical and normative reasons. We assessed if relative wild urban greenspaces, under little or no management, are associated with increased levels of biodiversity. We conducted a GIS-based relative wildness mapping for the Danish city Aarhus, and compared relative wildness to field-measured perceived biodiversity at 100 randomly placed sample sites in the city centre. Perceived biodiversity was estimated using the bioscore methodology. The results show a positive relationship between mapped wildness and bioscores, notably within artificial vegetated areas such as parks and gardens, while woodland had the highest wildness and bioscore values overall. All bioscore components measuring structural diversity increased with increasing mapped wildness. The bioscore component compositional richness covered site-level species richness for birds, invertebrates and plants, with invertebrate and bird species richness increasing and plant species richness decreasing with increasing wildness. The latter reflects that woodlands had low site-level plant diversity. Overall, woodlands nevertheless harboured many unique plant species, with woodlands and ruderal areas contributing the greatest beta diversity (inter-site variability in species composition). These findings show that urban greenspace management allowing for spontaneous ecological processes (greater wildness) overall also promotes urban biodiversity, pointing to potential synergies between urban design and management goals for reduced management intensity, increased wildness experiences, and higher biodiversity in urban greenspaces.}

To anticipate and minimize such impacts, landscape planning needs to be capable of effective strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and of supporting environmental impact assessment (EIA) decisions. To this end, species distribution models (SDMs) are an effective way of making predictive maps of the presence of a given species. In this paper, we propose to combine SDMs and graph-based representation of landscape networks to integrate the potential long-distance effect of infrastructures on species distribution. A diachronic approach, comparing distribution before and after the linear infrastructure is constructed, leads to the design of a species distribution assessment (SDA), taking into account population isolation. The SDA makes it possible (1) to estimate the local variation in probability of presence and (2) to characterize the impact of the infrastructure in terms of global variation in presence and of distance of disturbance. The method is illustrated by assessing the impact of the construction of a high-speed railway line on the distribution of several virtual species in Franche-Comté (France). The study shows the capacity of the SDA to characterize the impact of a linear infrastructure either as a research concern or as a spatial planning challenge. SDAs could be helpful in deciding among several scenarios for linear infrastructure routes or for the location of mitigation measures.}

abstract = {Transmission line (TL) siting consists of finding suitable land to build transmission towers. This is just one of the numerous complex geographical problems often solved using GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), which is a set of techniques that weight several geographical features to identify suitable locations. This technique is mostly employed using expert knowledge to identify the correct set of weights; thus adding a certain amount of subjectivity to the analysis, meaning that for the same problem if we change the experts involved, we may reach different results. This research is a first attempt to try and solve this issue. We employed a statistical analysis to quantitatively calculate these weights and we tested our method on a case study about transmission line siting in Switzerland. We compared the distances between each sample in our dataset, in this case study these are location of transmission towers, with each geographical feature, e.g. distance from water features. Then we calculate the same distances but for random points, sampled throughout the study area. The reasoning behind this method is that if samples present a distance from a geographic feature statistically different from the random, it means that the feature played an important role in dictating the location of the sample. In this case for instance, high-voltage transmission towers are purposely built as far away as possible from urban areas. Random points are on the contrary by definition sampled without any constraint. Therefore, when comparing the two datasets, we should find that transmission towers have a larger average distance from urban areas than random points. This allows us to determine that this criterion (i.e. distance from urban centers) is important for planning new TL. The results indicate that this method can successfully weight and rank the most important criteria to be considered for an MCDA analysis, in line with weights proposed in the literature. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it completely excludes human factors, thus potentially increasing the social acceptance of the MCDA results.}

abstract = {The objective of the present research is to develop methodological and computing tools to support the analysis and prioritization of new electric transmission line projects, in the prospection stage, aimed at greater efficiency and effectiveness of the advanced preparation of concessionaires and investors for participating in the auctions. These auctions are organized by the granting authorities (usually, regulatory agencies). The process of elaborating decisions on auction lots (possible “candidates”) is divided into two stages. The first one is associated with a study on relevant criteria modeled on the basis of applying Geographic Information Systems. The purpose of the first stage is to form the most rational multiobjective estimates of new transmission lines, which can be constructed and operated on analyzed lots. The included criteria are defined with a high level of uncertainty. Considering this, the general scheme of multiobjective decision making in conditions of uncertainty is applied to construct robust multiobjective estimates. This scheme presumes the building and analysis of payoff matrices. The solution of multiobjective problems for representative combinations of initial data, states of nature or scenarios is based on the use of a generalization of the well-known Dijkstra's algorithm (related to graph optimization, permitting the construction of transmission line routes) to analyze multiobjective problems. The second stage is directed at the definition, from the set of lots analyzed at the first stage, of a portfolio of the most appropriate and favorable areas for implanting transmission lines. This stage is based on applying techniques for preference modeling in a fuzzy environment within the framework of models of multiattribute decision making. Their use permits one to adequately consider criteria of quantitative character as well as criteria of qualitative character, whose estimates are based on knowledge, experience, and intuition of involved experts. The paper results are illustrated by a case study which demonstrates the rationality of their practical application, in addition to the strategic role that these results can play for concessionaires and investors, participating in auctions due to their ability to meet a wide range of criteria.}

abstract = {Least-cost path analysis (LCPA) allows designers to find the “cheapest” way to connect two locations within a cost surface, which can be computed by combining multiple criteria, and therefore by accounting for different issues (environmental impact, economic investment, etc.). This procedure can be easily implemented with modern Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, and consequently it has been widely employed to support planning and design of different types of linear infrastructures, ranging from roads to pipelines. This paper presents an approach based on the integration of multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and LCPA to identify the most suitable route for a 132kV power line. Criteria such as cost, visibility, population density, and ecosystem naturalness were used for the analysis. Firstly, spatial MCE and LCPA were combined to generate cost surfaces, and to identify alternative paths. Subsequently, MCE was used to compare the alternatives, and rank them according to their overall suitability. Finally, a sensitivity analysis allowed the stability of the results to be tested and the most critical factors of the evaluation to be detected. The study found that small changes in the location of the power line start and end points can result in significantly different paths, and consequently impact levels. This suggested that planners should always consider alternative potential locations of terminals in order to identify the best path. Furthermore, it was shown that the use of different weight scenarios may help making the model adaptable to varying environmental and social contexts. The approach was tested on a real-world case study in north-eastern Italy.}

This chapter highlights that modern telecommunications have evolved from the advent of the telephone, and many systems are related in some way to the first calls. Initially, analog signaling provided continuous waveforms on which data, including voice, could be transmitted. Digital signaling added compression, error correction and other services to the network. Internet protocol (IP) telephony and IP-based video conferencing solutions present many opportunities to organization, and at the same time introduces an entirely new set of challenges to overcome. IP telephony benefits organization by providing simplified administration, toll bypass, and a unified messaging platform. All of these benefits have the potential to save organization a great deal both administratively and monetarily when implemented correctly. Cisco provides a myriad of hardware and software to enable the transport of voice traffic over non-telephony networks.}

In order to evaluate how well the tessellation approximates the 2-dimensional space, we study three types of shortest paths: a weighted shortest path SPw(s,t), which is a shortest path from s to t in the space; a weighted shortest vertex path SVPw(s,t), which is an any-angle shortest path; and a weighted shortest grid path SGPw(s,t), which is a shortest path whose edges are edges of the tessellation. Given any arbitrary weight assignment to the faces of a triangular tessellation, thus extending recent results by Bailey et al. (2021) [6], we prove upper and lower bounds on the ratios ‖SGPw(s,t)‖‖SPw(s,t)‖, ‖SVPw(s,t)‖‖SPw(s,t)‖, ‖SGPw(s,t)‖‖SVPw(s,t)‖, which provide estimates on the quality of the approximation. It turns out, surprisingly, that our worst-case bounds are independent of any weight assignment. Our main result is that ‖SGPw(s,t)‖‖SPw(s,t)‖=23≈1.15 in the worst case, and this is tight. As a corollary, for the weighted any-angle path SVPw(s,t) we obtain the approximation result ‖SVPw(s,t)‖‖SPw(s,t)‖⪅1.15.}

In these rural electrification program, grid extension can be the best option if the grid is reliable, the rural community rather big and in proximity to the grid. In many circumstances, a strong case for mini-grids based on hybrid systems can be made. Scattered communities and isolated houses are well served by solar and small hydro (where available) or small wind energy systems. By feeding renewable electricity to the utility grid through the grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system, during time of peak demand, sufficient electrical loads can be shed to prevent turning on a coal or natural gas-fired plant and therefore save CO2 emissions and potentially energy import costs, replacing fossil fuels. The Social, Economic, and Environmental Benefits can be achieved through this proposition. Also, the Grid Interactive Operation of SPV System at Moushuni Island is tested.

Such problems have been posed as multiobjective programming models. This paper presents a novel user interface that is designed to help explore possible alternative corridors. This new interface allows for exploration in terms of both objective space and decision space and could be modified for other spatial decision-making problems as well.}

As special conservation elements, we identified Priority Areas for Conservation of species using five criteria: species richness, geographic rarity, species vulnerability, a Combined Index of these three criteria, and a Standardised Biodiversity Index (SBI) that integrate the three criteria and four studied taxa. The Natura 2000 Network was used to include conservation areas for focal species. We evaluated the representation of every landscape type in the existing conservation areas. To delineate the spatial configuration for vertebrate conservation, we combined the identified Priority Areas for Conservation, existing conservation areas and connectivity areas by cost–distance analysis. The Combined Index was the most efficient criterion analyzed to identify Priority Areas for Conservation. The Natura 2000 Network showed a high percentage of coincidence with identified Priority Areas for Conservation, whereas the natural protected areas network had a low percentage of coincidence. Six agricultural landscapes were inadequately represented in the current conservation network. According to our multi-track approach, ∼29% of study area was required to capture 100% of vertebrate species and all landscape types. Our results show that the existing conservation areas are insufficient to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity in the study region. Additional areas with outstanding features of diversity, connectivity areas, and establishment of targets for off-reserve conservation are of fundamental importance for strengthening biodiversity conservation.}

Most female Chiru populations are seasonal long-distance migrants, but their migration routes (corridors) remain mysterious on the QTP. Three adjacent nature reserves (i.e. Altun, Kekexili, Qiangtang nature reserves) have been established to protect the endangered ungulate species and their habitats on the QTP, but they are delineated and managed according to the administrative boundaries. In this study, we employed a GIS-based model (i.e., Linkage Mapper tool) to identify potential movement corridors of Chiru according to the principle of Least Cost Path. We also examined the impacts of human activities on the spatial patterns and conservation status of the identified movement corridors of Chiru. Our results indicated that only 66% of the movement corridors for Chiru were captured by the existing reserves, whilst 76% of the corridors were disturbed by human activities with a relatively high overall disturbance index. The human disturbance index within the existing reserves was considerably lower than that outside the reserves, indicating the conservation efficacy of the reserves. This research developed the conservation strategy for different categories of the corridors (inside, outside, inter-reserve, opening) for Chiru considering their spatial relationship with the existing nature reserves, and highlighted urgent needs to implement trans-boundary conservation strategy by protecting those corridors connecting the existing nature reserves across the alpine desert of QTP.}

Presently, wind potential is limited by a paucity of electrical transmission lines and/or capacity between promising wind resources and primary load centers. We present the model SimWIND to address this shortfall. SimWIND is an integrated optimization model for the geospatial arrangement and cost minimization of wind-power generation–transmission–delivery infrastructure. Given a set of possible wind-farm sites, the model simultaneously determines (1) where and how much power to generate and (2) where to build new transmission infrastructure and with what capacity in order to minimize the cost for delivering a targeted amount of power to load. Costs and routing of transmission lines consider geographic and social constraints as well as electricity losses. We apply our model to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Interconnection, considering scenarios that deliver up to 20GW of new wind power. We show that SimWIND could potentially reduce ERCOT's projected ∼$5B transmission network upgrade line length and associated costs by 50%. These results suggest that SimWIND's coupled generation–transmission–delivery modeling approach could play a critical role in enhancing planning efforts and reducing costs for wind energy integration.}

abstract = {Marcellus Shale development is occurring rapidly and relatively unconstrained across Pennsylvania (PA). Through 2013, over 7400 unconventional wells had been drilled in the Commonwealth. Well pads, access roads, and gathering lines fragment forestland resulting in irreversible alterations to the forest ecosystem. Changes in forest quantity, composition, and structural pattern can result in increased predation, brood parasitism, altered light, wind, and noise intensity, and spread of invasive species. These fragmentation effects pose a risk to PA's rich biodiversity. This study projects the structure of future alternative pathways for Marcellus shale development and quantifies the potential ecological impact of future drilling using a core forest region of Bradford County, PA. Modeling presented here suggests that future development could cause the level of fragmentation in the study area to more than double throughout the lifetime of gas development. Specifically, gathering lines are responsible for approximately 94% of the incremental fragmentation in the core forest study region. However, by requiring gathering lines to follow pre-existing road routes in forested regions, shale resources can be exploited to their full potential, while essentially preventing any further fragmentation from occurring across the core forested landscape of Bradford County. In the study region, assuming an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 1–3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per well, this policy could be implemented for a minimal incremental economic investment of approximately $0.005–$0.02 per Mcf of natural gas produced over the modeled traditional gathering line development.}

Transmission Lines (TLs) impact assessments focus less on the first level (avoidance) of the mitigation hierarchy (MH) and more on the inferior levels (minimization, restoration, and compensation). Thus, designing TLs routes that avoid adverse environmental effects becomes an important challenge. Unfortunately, the environmental perspective is still poorly considered and incorporated too late into the projects, causing conflicts in the assessments due to divergent stakeholders' opinions. Identifying conflicting areas early is essential to avoid adding cost and delay to the project. Here, we proposed a decision workflow of route design which includes: i) the proposal of alternative routes using Geographic Information System and Least Cost Path Analysis based on two sets of fuzzy criteria – engineering and environmental; ii) an experimental approach with gradual variation among five scenarios that integrate engineering and environmental perspectives, based on Spatial Multi-criteria Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process; and iii) identification of route segments characterized by consensus between engineering and environmental perspectives, using a moving window analysis. Our findings show that the scenarios with the higher influence of environmental criteria achieved better performances in all environmental metrics. The spatial convergence among segments of all five modeled alternatives represents less conflict between environmental and engineering perspectives. We recommend that impact assessment of power lines should start taking advantage of the first level of the mitigation hierarchy (impact avoidance). This will represent a gain in the effectiveness of the impact assessment outcomes, a better focus on residual impacts during the following MH phases, a decrease in conflict level during the licensing process, and a potential reduction in project implementation time.}

abstract = {Cluster-first route-second methods like the sweep heuristic (Gillett and Miller, 1974) are well known in vehicle routing. They determine clusters of customers compatible with vehicle capacity and solve a traveling salesman problem for each cluster. The opposite approach, called route-first cluster-second, builds a giant tour covering all customers and splits it into feasible trips. Cited as a curiosity for a long time but lacking numerical evaluation, this technique has nevertheless led to successful metaheuristics for various vehicle routing problems in the last decade. As many implementations consider an ordering of customers instead of building a giant tour, we propose in this paper the more general name of ordering-first split-second methods. This article shows how this approach can be declined for different vehicle routing problems and reviews the associated literature, with more than 70 references.}

abstract = {Recently, the global trend has increased to use renewable energies more widely. Several factors have helped the development of this sector, including generous investment, the country's strategy and strong will, and increasing public awareness. Photovoltaic is one of the most common and widely used types of energy. In the current status, this source is the available option that the population of Yemen depends on as a result of the deterioration of the frequent power service from the national grid and the periodic economic crises. However, most Yemen-related studies are confined to off-grid systems. Such systems would increase the financial burden on citizens with limited income. This study works to improve the electric grid performance by injecting three photovoltaic-based distributed generations (PV-DG) in Aden, Yemen. The authors have proposed three distinct cases, each of which involves the implementation of four methodologies, categorized into primary and secondary approaches. Primary methods encompass the optimal geographical PV site selection and PV-DG allocation (size and bus bar in the grid). Secondary methods include the initial PV design and the Least Costly Path Model (LCPM). The workflow begins with identifying suitable locations using the AHP-WLC method with GIS. Subsequently, optimal PV-DG sizes and bus bars are determined using the ABC algorithm to minimize power loss. The third stage involves PV design to refine the search area, and the final stage utilizes LCPM to determine the best option among optimal geolocations. The most suitable PV geolocations are found on 204. 38 km2 for the first and second cases, while 76. 28 km2 for the third case. Even though case (3) generates less area, this is more acceptable due to the neglect of evaluation climate criteria. In contrast, the total injected active power is determined about 15.7 MW and 26 MW for cases (1) and (2 and 3), respectively. Even though the small size is found in case (1), the considering partial grid allows more flexibility. Based on the results obtained, the authors are confident that the current study will mitigate the burden on the national grid and thus improve the individual's life. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be considered one of the bases for further studies of other technologies of renewable energy.}

Hence, this research presented a novel AI model for optimizing “overhead power transmitting lines” (OHPTL) routing using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique. The proposed technique depends on the core routine (which can generate random and valid routes and estimate their total cost) and searching algorithm (which uses ACO technique to find the optimum route among the generated routes). As a prototype, the proposed technique was codes in “Visual Basic for Applications” VBA, while MS-EXCEL was used to handle the graphical inputs and outputs. The functionality of the technique was validated using three virtual case studies and its optimization capability was tested using a real-life case study. The results showed that the total cost of the optimized route is about 75% of the existing route.}

With citizens’ increasing awareness, they expect to be transparently informed, their concerns to be taken seriously and that decision-makers base their decisions rationally on facts and laws. In this paper, we present a 3D Decision Support System (3D DSS) that tackles this issue and allows decision-makers to find an optimal transmission line corridor on such rational basis and by considering stakeholder’s preferences regarding multiple criteria. We examined its reliability regarding the ability of predicting transmission line corridors realistically—as stakeholders would expect them—by carrying out a study in central Switzerland with 10 grid planning experts and government representatives. Moreover, we investigated the extent to which graphic representations may support decision-makers firstly in evaluating a transmission line corridor modeled by the 3D DSS, secondly in considering and improving a human-defined scenario for transmission line planning, and thirdly in changing their opinion about a human-defined path. For this, a questionnaire was statistically evaluated by means of exploratory analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. The results on the investigated visual analytics approach showed that it supports the evaluation of the corridor modeled by the 3D DSS as well as of the scenario defined by the stakeholders. As our new approach allows stakeholders to evaluate a transmission line path they consider to be optimal for land and population, it has a high potential for supporting rational group decision-making when considering different opinions.}

In this research, least-cost distance and least-cost path models were employed to establish potential ecological corridors based on the resistance at the site of the wind power projects––which is located in the ecological function area in Qinyuan, South Shanxi Province, China. The landscape connectivity was evaluated using a set of connectivity indices. In addition, the impact on the corridor patency, length, and the connectivity between ecological corridors were analyzed. The results showed that the wind power projects could not only significantly increase the migration resistance that hampers the formation of ecological corridors of the species at the landscape scale, but also had an obvious cutting effect on the landscape––resulting in an increase in the length of the ecological corridors and a decrease in corridor patency and landscape connectivity. There was also a positive relationship between the increase in length and the distance between the source patches. In addition, the connectivity was enhanced with the increase in distance threshold. This study evaluated the ecological impact of onshore wind power projects at the landscape level, filling the gap in research on landscape ecology, especially in the protected area with key ecological function. Meanwhile, the results are beneficial to guide the location selection for wind power projects and minimize their negative impact on the key ecological corridors.}

Turkey, is very rich in terms of its solar energy potential enabling it to use the sun as a means of generating energy. Thanks to marginal lands such as non-residential areas, agricultural areas and industrial areas, electricity production is provided by means of renewable energy sources. Since land is a scarce resource, optimal use of it is a spatial necessity. In developed societies its usage is determined in the environmental plan based on criteria related to industry, agriculture etc. and presented to decision makers for their approval. However, in these plans, natural energy potentials such as the sun and wind can often be ignored. This lack of planning hinders the effective utilization of the solar energy potential. A case study has been carried out to better understand this issue. The most commonly used Solar Power Plant criteria have been determined with the literature review, an informal interview with SPP experts and the authors’ experiences and these criteria have been weighted with the Analytical Hierarchy Process method. A cost-surface map has been produced for the study area and the environmental plan has been associated with it. It has been determined that areas that have a very high solar energy potential in the cost-surface map have been planned for urban, commercial or different purposes in the environmental plans. In spite of the fact that the solar energy potential atlas shows the same solar potential for the study area, there are still huge differences in terms of solar energy potential among some regions in the study area. For this reason, it is not logical to build SPP facilities based only on the solar energy potential atlas. It is suggested to determine natural energy potential spatially throughout the country and consider it before the environmental plans are prepared. In addition, those wanting to research this subject are recommended to conduct studies in areas promoting alternative methods according to alternative site selection criteria including geographical and soil characteristics.}

Our goal was to identify specific regions of the south Florida landscape that are of high conservation value to support a self-sustaining panther population. We used compositional and Euclidean distance analyses to determine relative importance of various land cover types as panther habitat and to investigate the role of forest patch size in habitat selection. A model of landscape components important to Florida panther habitat conservation was created. The model was used in combination with radio telemetry records, home range overlaps, land use/land cover data, and satellite imagery to delineate Primary and Secondary zones that would comprise a landscape mosaic of cover types sufficient to support a self-sustaining population. The Primary Zone generally supports the present population and is of highest conservation value, while the Secondary Zone is of lesser value but could accommodate expansion of the population given sufficient habitat restoration. Least-cost path models identified important landscape linkages, and model results were used to delineate a Dispersal Zone to accommodate future panther dispersal outside of south Florida. We determined that the three habitat zones could support 80–94 panthers, a population likely to persist and remain stable for 100 years, but that would be subject to continued genetic problems. The Primary, Dispersal and Secondary zones comprise essential components of a landscape-scale conservation plan for the protection of a viable Florida panther population in south Florida. Assessments of potential impacts of developments should strive to achieve no net loss of landscape function or carrying capacity for panthers within the Primary Zone or throughout the present range of the Florida panther.}

In this paper, we investigate P2P energy trading driven by the electrical distance between agents in a low-voltage network. Our market design considers the role of a distributed system operator (DSO) who determines the shortest path between agents, encoded in preference lists. The DSO submits the preference lists to the agents but does not intervene in the P2P matching process. Specifically, we propose two decentralised P2P market mechanisms that are induced by the relations in the preference lists. First, we introduce a stable-matching (SM) algorithm for matching agents and guaranteeing that no agents want to mutually deviate from the matching. Second, a mechanism based on a continuous double auction (CDA) is adopted for continually matching peers. The proposed mechanisms are tested on a UK low-voltage network. Simulation results show that the outcome of the proposed SM mechanism faces a trade-off between the stability of the matching and market efficiency, whereas the proposed CDA-based mechanism deviates from the stable outcome but can still capture the high market efficiency of the CDA. We show that a P2P market driven by electrical distance leads to reduced losses and line congestion in both mechanisms.}

Expectations to the positive effect of economies of scale on power production costs, however, have not materialized as yet. On the contrary, anticipated electricity generation costs have been on the increase for each increment of technology scale. Moreover, the cost reductions anticipated for progressing along a technological learning curve have are not apparent, and it seems that not all the additional costs can be explained by deeper water, higher distance to shore, bottlenecks in supply or higher raw material costs. The present paper addresses the scale of offshore wind parks for Denmark and invites to reconsider the technological and institutional choices made. Based on a continuous resource-economic model operating in a geographical information systems (GIS) environment, which describes resources, costs and area constraints in a spatially explicit way, the relation between project size, location, costs and ownership is analysed. Two scenarios are presented, which describe a state-of-the-art development as well as a sketch of smaller, locally owned parks that may have several economic advantages but require a greater planning and acceptance because of higher visual impact and area competition.}

Therefore, we sought to identify how landcover, anthropogenic features, and human policy (i.e., presence of the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP]) influenced roost site selection and movement patterns of the LEPC. From March to May 2013–2015, we captured and fitted GPS transmitters to 106 LEPCs (n = 72 males; n = 34 females) within Beaver County, Oklahoma and recorded two nocturnal locations per 24-hour period, annually. We used discrete choice models and generalized linear mixed effects models to determine how vegetation cover, CRP patches, and anthropogenic features influenced roost site selection and movements to roosting sites, respectively. We found that roost sites were closer to CRP, leks, and croplands than would be expected at random. Conversely, roost sites were located farther away from shortgrass prairie, roads, and transmission lines than expected. The probability of a LEPC roosting in a location increased by 15% and 4.5% for every 36-meter decrease in distance to a CRP patch and distance to their lek of capture, respectively. Similarly, individuals roosting in CRP patches would travel shorter distances to get to roost sites if their last diurnal location was near CRP. Bird’s movements to roosts in CRP were 1.4 times shorter for every meter decrease in the distance of their last diurnal location to a CRP patch, indicating that individuals modify their movement based on CRP presence. Our results indicate that CRP is influential to roosting ecology of the LEPC within this region and may be meeting critical cover requirements.}

The typical load patterns and load growth of residential, commercial and industrial customers are derived by a load survey system and then used to solve the transformer copper loss and core loss. The three-phase load flow analysis is performed to solve the yearly peak power loss and annual energy loss according to the customer typical load patterns. The transformer peak power loss and energy loss as well as the initial investment cost, installation cost and depreciation cost of distribution transformers are combined to form the overall cost function. The dynamic programming (DP) is then applied to find the optimal capacity and installation strategy of distribution transformers. To verify the accuracy of the proposed methodology, a practical Taipower distribution feeder has been selected for computer simulation. The conventional transformer sizing by considering the customer peak loading is also investigated for comparison. It is found that more than 5% of overall life cycle cost of distribution transformers can be saved by the proposed optimal transformer sizing strategy.}

To properly assess their impact in different settings at country or cross-country level, microgrids must be designed for each particular situation, which leads to computationally intractable problems. To tackle this issue, a methodology is proposed to create surrogate models using machine learning techniques and a database of microgrids. The selected regression model is based on Gaussian Processes and allows to drastically decrease the computation time relative to the optimal deployment of the technology. The results indicate that the proposed methodology can accurately predict key optimization variables for the design of the microgrid system. The regression models are especially well suited to estimate the net present cost and the levelized cost of electricity (R2 = 0.99 and 0.98). Their accuracy is lower when predicting internal system variables such as installed capacities of PV and batteries (R2 = 0.92 and 0.86). A least-cost path towards 100% electrification coverage for the Bolivian lowlands mid-size communities is finally computed, demonstrating the usability and computational efficiency of the proposed framework.}

Improved highways arrived later but based on an entirely different approach; these were maintained by a highway department which carried out numerous improvements over time based on goals of reducing travel cost. This engineered highway network has little in common with the earlier road network and remains in use today. This research will examine these changing road networks of the Mojave Desert from 1917 to 1940 to identify whether the changing purpose of these routes can explain how one road network so effectively replaced another despite using the same type of vehicles. Maps of the 1917, 1922, and 1940 road networks were digitized and cost distance routes generated in GIS in an attempt to replicate both the 1917 and 1940 networks. The expectation is that the 1940 network was based on optimization while that of 1917 was instead based on creating feasible routes between water sources that avoided physical barriers. The ability of cost distance routes to replicate the 1940 routes but not those of 1917 confirms that these two networks were based on different principles. Despite this transition a few early roads remain in the desert and the mapping work of the USGS remains relevant in the twenty first century.}

Examples include routing of school buses, mail delivery vehicles, street sweepers and many others. The CARP has been shown to be NP-hard, and, therefore, heuristic procedures are desired to solve the CARP approximately. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms to solve the CARP near-optimally. Computational results show that the new algorithms outperform the existing procedures on sparse networks with large arc demands.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter provides detailed design and configuration information on Cisco Aironet wireless bridges. Wireless bridges operate at Layers 1 (Data Link) and 2 (Physical) of the OSI reference model and are used to interlink distinct LAN segments to form a single logical whole. Bridges learn the location (local or remote) of devices using static configuration inputted by administrators, dynamic configurations generated using intelligent routing protocols, and by analyzing the flow of traffic over the various bridge interfaces. Wireless bridges are used to bridge cabled LAN segments over distances ranging from a few feet to twenty or more miles. When establishing a wireless bridge network, one needs to consider two factors: line of sight and Fresnel K Zones. The Cisco wireless bridge family is made up of two distinct series of components, the 340 wireless bridge and the 350 wireless bridge. The main difference between these two wireless bridge series revolves primarily around the transmitter power. The 340 series wireless bridge can transmit at up to 30 milliwatts, whereas the 350 series wireless bridge can transmit at up to 100 milliwatts. The quick installation and configuration steps used during the initial setup of the wireless bridge involve configuring the wireless bridge from the console interface (default setting 9600 8N1) to define the base antenna, radio, and ethernet port baseline configurations.}

abstract = {European and global urbanisation is increasing. For the urban population, the woodlands in the urban and peri-urban landscape are important as places for recreation and contact with nature among other functions. This paper presents a geographical information system (GIS) based model to classify urban woodlands by urban pressure, of which visitor pressure is a key component. The model identifies and uses distance, accessibility and quality of woodland as key components affecting visitation rates for urban woodland. The model was applied to the Malmö-Lund region in Sweden, a highly urbanised area with few areas accessible for recreation. Validation of the model was through field inventory of indicators of urban pressure. The classification identifies woodlands with a high priority for including visitor pressure in management planning.}

abstract = {This paper examines the impact of location and load shape selection on microgrid optimal design. 96 unique combinations of location and load shape are considered to provide a broader scope than any previous work in microgrid design sensitivity analysis. In addition, the level of autonomy from the macrogrid is considered as a tunable parameter in the optimization. A generic system is considered consisting of photovoltaics, wind turbine, microturbines, electric and natural gas boilers, thermal storage, and a battery bank. The microgrid is grid-connected and designed to supply both heat and power. A mixed integer linear program is used to minimize the expected cost of energy supply over a 20 year horizon. Trends in the design results are discussed and important input parameters that depend on the location and load shape are identified. Finally, a procedure to quantify these trends and predict optimal design results in new locations is proposed.}
