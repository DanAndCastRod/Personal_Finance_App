	abstract = {This study uses a Least Cost Path Analysis (LCPA) to create a transmission suitability route map. Environmental issues including electromagnetic pollution, habitat fragmentation, forest clearing, and the sight of pylons and power lines, and electromagnetic pollution are just a few that may come up during the planning and construction phases. The study's objectives are to define the criteria for a suitable transmission route, map the current transmission from Kidurong to Kemena in Bintulu, Sarawak, and suggest a new, LCPA-based transmission route that meets these criteria. It is necessary to determine the criteria that influence the construction of the route. There are three main categories for the proposed routes. There are technical, human health, and natural environments. The road layer and slope layer are combined for the technical group. The residential layer is part of the human health group, and land use is associated with the natural environment. During the planning of a potential power line route, weight was assigned to the criterion maps. The outcome demonstrates that the suggested route was built based on most flat sections, with only a little portion passing through the sharpest sector because there is no other way to depart from the path to avoid it. The output route is nearly straight from the source location to the destination point. The route also curves in a couple of places to go around the step area. The proposed transmission line is inside the buffer zone, and there are no other routes in the area that are more than 1 km from the road. Class 1 has a low dwelling density; therefore, the route passes through it for the residential evaluation. Additionally, there are a few places where the route passes through class 2 because only class 2 has a lower housing density.  © 2023 by MIP.},

	abstract = {Building new power lines is fundamental to supply the growing energy demand worldwide. Transmission Lines (TLs) impact assessments focus less on the first level (avoidance) of the mitigation hierarchy (MH) and more on the inferior levels (minimization, restoration, and compensation). Thus, designing TLs routes that avoid adverse environmental effects becomes an important challenge. Unfortunately, the environmental perspective is still poorly considered and incorporated too late into the projects, causing conflicts in the assessments due to divergent stakeholders' opinions. Identifying conflicting areas early is essential to avoid adding cost and delay to the project. Here, we proposed a decision workflow of route design which includes: i) the proposal of alternative routes using Geographic Information System and Least Cost Path Analysis based on two sets of fuzzy criteria – engineering and environmental; ii) an experimental approach with gradual variation among five scenarios that integrate engineering and environmental perspectives, based on Spatial Multi-criteria Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process; and iii) identification of route segments characterized by consensus between engineering and environmental perspectives, using a moving window analysis. Our findings show that the scenarios with the higher influence of environmental criteria achieved better performances in all environmental metrics. The spatial convergence among segments of all five modeled alternatives represents less conflict between environmental and engineering perspectives. We recommend that impact assessment of power lines should start taking advantage of the first level of the mitigation hierarchy (impact avoidance). This will represent a gain in the effectiveness of the impact assessment outcomes, a better focus on residual impacts during the following MH phases, a decrease in conflict level during the licensing process, and a potential reduction in project implementation time. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Since new (Power) Transmission Lines (TLs) can have a long-term effect on the makeup of a landscape and on the human living space, it should be expected that the route of any new TL will be based on objective criteria that take into account the views of the public. Geographic Information Science (GIScience) provides powerful tools that assist in the determination of feasible locations for new TLs based on objective criteria and georeferenced data by combining methods from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Least Cost Path (LCP) analysis. If such an approach is applied, the LCP analysis usually yields one optimal result. However, stakeholders and decision-makers prefer to compare multiple distinct path alternatives in order to find a solution that will be acceptable to as many stakeholders as possible. We have developed a method that calculates spatially distinct and Pareto optimal path alternatives based on the same cost surface using an algorithm for determining valleys on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to determine local low-cost points, which were then connected to a network graph by geometrical rules. Finally, we selected all non-dominated path alternatives that represented Pareto optimal conditions regarding a specific main objective. We then asked ten expert stakeholders to cross-compare the calculated path alternatives and assess our novel method. The concept of applying linear programming to obtain Pareto optimal path alternatives yielded routings that were mostly preferred over the LCP and had a greater likelihood of being realized than the results obtained by conducting the LCP analysis. The stakeholders determined the method's key concept to be useful and assert it a high potential to support planning, matter-of-fact argumentation, and discussions about TL routing. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The establishment of cost surface model forms the basis for conducting path optimization in continuous spaces. In most cases, path optimisation calculation in continuous spaces is based on a single-resolution cost surface model, which, however, would trigger problems in the meanwhile such as data redundancy, high computational costs, susceptibility to the "edge effect" of ground features, etc., when it is applied in solving path optimisation problems regarding constructions of power lines, pipelines, roads, railways and so forth. With the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, a variable-resolution raster cost surface model is proposed for path optimisation, elaborating its design ideas and modelling method. The experimental results show that, by establishing this model, not only can the ground feature density and terrain complexity be modeled effectively, but the problems arising from the application of the single-resolution model can also be settled. After a comparative analysis on the calculation result of this model and that of the traditional single resolution cost surface model, findings show that the proposed model is capable of achieving reasonable paths in varied environments with high computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {Least-cost path analysis (LCPA) allows designers to find the "cheapest" way to connect two locations within a cost surface, which can be computed by combining multiple criteria, and therefore by accounting for different issues (environmental impact, economic investment, etc.). This procedure can be easily implemented with modern Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, and consequently it has been widely employed to support planning and design of different types of linear infrastructures, ranging from roads to pipelines. This paper presents an approach based on the integration of multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and LCPA to identify the most suitable route for a 132. kV power line. Criteria such as cost, visibility, population density, and ecosystem naturalness were used for the analysis. Firstly, spatial MCE and LCPA were combined to generate cost surfaces, and to identify alternative paths. Subsequently, MCE was used to compare the alternatives, and rank them according to their overall suitability. Finally, a sensitivity analysis allowed the stability of the results to be tested and the most critical factors of the evaluation to be detected. The study found that small changes in the location of the power line start and end points can result in significantly different paths, and consequently impact levels. This suggested that planners should always consider alternative potential locations of terminals in order to identify the best path. Furthermore, it was shown that the use of different weight scenarios may help making the model adaptable to varying environmental and social contexts. The approach was tested on a real-world case study in north-eastern Italy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In practice, the calculation of connection costs for each new consumer includes the network design and financial expenditure. We suggest that connection costs should be calculated for the whole city based on the normative parameters at the stage when the object location is selected by investors and when power grid development is planned by power companies. The proposed method enables the modeling of new power line connection routes from every parcel of city land to possible points of connection to the operating networks based on the raster design of the area. The optimal path is chosen by one criterion consisting of two components: the costs of both laying new power lines and providing sufficient power reserve in the chosen network connection point. Realized as a computer program, the method has been used to calculate the costs of connections to low-voltage power lines. © 2016 Wuhan University.},
