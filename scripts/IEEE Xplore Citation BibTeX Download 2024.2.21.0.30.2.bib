  abstract={Conductor galloping is known to be a complicated phenomenon as different aerodynamic characteristics, galloping mechanisms are involved. To tackle the galloping problem of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, this study designs a torsional tuned mass damper (TTMD) with eddy current mechanism. For a full-span iced conductor with multiple TTMDs (MTTMD), motion equations of galloping are derived and discretized using the Galerkin method. A multi-objective optimization framework using genetic algorithm for anti-galloping of conductors is proposed. The optimization objectives include critical wind speed at galloping initiation, galloping amplitude and damper stroke, which cover the wind conditions with frequent occurrence and large galloping amplitude. By using satisfaction function and weighting factor for each objective, the multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single objective optimization problem. For the weighting factors, the Analytic Hierarchy Process and random sampling method are employed to simulate the expert decision-making process with high efficiency, and reasonable ranges of the weighting factors are available for selection. The results of a numerical study show that the MTTMD with optimum design can achieve satisfying anti-galloping effectiveness on the bundled conductor, significantly increasing critical wind speed and suppressing the galloping amplitude. The robustness of the optimization method is also verified.},

  abstract={Electrical Transmission Lines (ETL) design is normally performed aiming to reach minimum cost while satisfying project requirements. However, achieving one only design goal may not be sufficient, as the designer may need to impose other technical design metrics. This work aims to perform the ETL design task while offering the designer the possibility to impose other design goals than cost, like the ETL reliability efficiency. Multiobjective optimization algorithms are therefore suggested to perform the design task. An improved multiobjective integer version of Particle Swarm Optimization, the Integer Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (IMOPSO), is proposed in this paper. The IMOPSO is applied in order to solve the multiobjective ETL design showing promising results. Conclusions are drawn regarding the IMOPSO algorithm performance and design results, through statistical analysis.},

  abstract={Power system instability is a serious concern in the power industry. Even a temporary blackout and power outage can lead to the relative chaos, monetary setbacks and possible loss of life. In the electricity network, the power generation must be very close to equal every second as possible to the electrical load demand. Else, it will create overloading and congestion in network components which may cause severe damage technically as well as economically. It is crucial to have a power system network with high efficiency, maximum reliability and security in its design and operation. One of the recent electronics development is the introduction of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers in power system. This controller demonstrates its ability to control the power network in very efficient manner. Hence the features can be exploited to enhance the power system stability. This paper aims to study the effect of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) to mitigate the weakness of the transmission line by locating TCSC at the most sensitive line thru reactive power loss sensitivity indices approach. Multi-objective optimization which are mitigation of the line contingencies, total reactive power loss reduction and transmission line loadability on the tested modified IEEE small 5 bus network and large 14 bus network are presented. Apart from that, the effect of degree of compensation of TCSC was also covered. The investigation was carried out using MATLAB/MATPOWER 5.0 and Power World Simulator GSO 18. This study concludes that the proposed approach is efficient for solving line contingencies, power loss reduction and line loadability in transmission network.},

  abstract={This paper develops a reliability-based model for distribution network expansion planning (DNEP) studies. It incorporates the effects of distribution line maintenance in the planning studies to be considered as an alternative for the installation of feeders. To that end, at first, some models are introduced to effectively estimate the effects of maintenance activities budget on distribution lines' failure and repair rates. Therefore, the reliability data of distribution lines are updated in the reliability evaluation studies of distribution networks. Then, these models are involved in the formulation of DNEP problem which is introduced as a multi-objective optimization model. The developed model is solved using the NSGA-II algorithm as a promising technique in solving mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. The proposed model is tested on IEEE RBTS-Bus6 test system and the results are discussed.},

  abstract={Rotary travelling wave oscillator (RTWO) represents a transmission line based technology for multigigahertz clock generation. RTWO design is a multi-parameter-multi-objective problem with tradeoffs of performance measures, power and phase noise. In this paper, non-dominated based genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization is used to determine the Pareto optimal front of solutions for low power and phase noise with emphasis on variation of transmission line width and spacing. Optimization is followed by sensitivity assessment wherein Monte Carlo simulations and corner analysis are performed on the Pareto points with respect to process variations. The algorithm is validated in the design of RTWO whose frequency varies between 3 to 5 GHz due to varying dimensions of coupled transmission line. The optimization is a two step process. A neural network is developed from experimental data to estimate phase noise and power with transmission line width and spacing as inputs. The neural network is then coupled with genetic algorithm for subsequent design optimization. Our results show a set of solutions for width and spacing with objective functions less sensitive to process variations.},

  number={},
  pages={88-93},
  abstract={Although the major parts of function blocks for the satellite navigation receivers are fully integrated in a CMOS chip in most cases, it is convenient to create an antenna preamplifier as a separate circuit based on a low-noise pHEMT. Such an RF front end can be strongly optimized to attain a trade-off between the noise figure and transducer power gain. Furthermore, as all the principal navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and Compass) work in similar frequency band (roughly from 1.1 to 1.7 GHz), it is reasonable to create this low-noise preamplifier for all of them. In the paper, a sophisticated method of the amplifier design is suggested based on multi-objective optimization. First, an extraction of pHEMT model parameters was performed, including comparisons among several models. The extraction was carried out by our original three-step robust identification procedure based on a combination of meta-heuristic and direct optimization methods. Second, a substantial improvement of a standard method for the multi-objective optimization is outlined. Third, the equations of passive elements of the circuit (including transmission lines and T splitters) were carefully defined using frequency dispersion of their parameters as Q, ESR, etc. Fourth, an optimal selection of the amplifier operating point and essential passive elements was performed using the previously improved goal attainment method. Finally, the s-parameters and noise figure of the proposed preamplifier were measured, and the third-order intermodulation products were also checked.},

  abstract={Differentiation planning reasonably has instruction function for strengthening the construction of the distribution network structure with pertinence, as well as improving the ability of withstanding natural disasters. A method of differentiation planning of distribution network structure was proposed, based on its weaknesses. Aimed at the situations of natural disasters and important consumers, network reconfiguration with the objective to minimize the load shedding was used to search for the post-disaster structure. After that, the assessment of economy and resilience index were applied with planning, the optimal planning was determined with the operation method of technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). By the analysis of example, the resilience assessment of structure weakness plays a conductive role of differentiation planning on distribution network.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={22724-22744},
  abstract={In this paper, the optimal designing of passive power filter (PPF) is formulated as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem under several constraints of system's performance indices (PIs) such as individual as well as total harmonic distortion (THD) in the line current and the point of common coupling's (PCC) voltage, distribution line's ampacity under harmonic currents overloading, steady-state voltage profile, load power factor (PF) and a few associated with the filter itself. The optimal design parameters of a third-order damped filter are simultaneously determined for achieving maximum PF at the PCC while keeping system's other indices such as total demand distortion (TDD) in the line current, total voltage harmonic distortion (TVHD) at the PCC and total filter cost (FC) incurred at a minimum by obtaining a best-compromised solution using the newly proposed multi-objective Pareto-based firefly algorithm (pb-MOFA). A novel MOO approach inspired by the modified firefly algorithm and Pareto front is established in order to deal with PPF design problems. The extension of MOFA is considered for producing the Pareto optimal front and various conclusions are drawn by analysing the trade-offs among the objectives. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed pb-MOFA, in solving the concerned MOO problem, is validated by comparing an obtained solution and three computed PIs viz. convergence metric (CM), generational distance (GD) and diversity metric (DM) with those obtained from popular multi-objective Pareto-based PSO (pb-MOPSO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and recently introduced multi-objective slime mould algorithm (MOSMA). The need for true Pareto front (TPF) is served by the one obtained by Monte Carlo method. At last, the impacts of different background voltage distortion (BVD) levels and load-side's nonlinearity levels (NLLs) on filter performance are analysed.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of path planning in an environment with many terrains, we propose a method based on interval multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, the environment is modeled by the line partition method, and then, according to the distribution of the polygonal lines which form the robot path and taking the velocity's disturbance into consideration, robot's passing time is formulated as an interval by combining Local Optimal Criterion (LOC), and the path's danger degree is estimated through the area ratio between the robot path and the danger source. In addition, the path length is also calculated as an optimization objective. As a result, the robot path planning problem is modeled as an optimization problem with three objectives. Finally, the interval multiobjective PSO is employed to solve the problem above. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  pages={822-827},
  abstract={Planning of protection systems has been a significant task in order to achieve an efficient behavior of distribution systems. Feeders that offer high robustness and reliability are essential to ensure continuous energy delivering to all customer loads. Since distributed generation (DG) has increased its penetration in distribution systems, it has become necessary to place protective devices (such as reclosers) in order to allow DG islanded operation, which decreases the energy not supplied. This paper addresses efficient placement of normally closed reclosers (NCRs). A multi-objective optimization is defined to reduce SAIDI, SAIFI, and system costs. This approach yields optimal planning of NCRs by applying the non-dominated sorting differential evolution algorithm (NSDE). The NSDE is implemented in Matlab, while the power system is modeled in DigSILENT in order to employ a co-simulation environment. Simulations are developed on a real test feeder for two cases: i) without DG; and ii) with 6 MW penetration of distributed sources.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a reliability-oriented planning method to design reliable topologies for meshed high-voltage direct-current (HVdc) grids. Based on the proposed steady-state model for HVdc grids, a bi-level and multiobjective planning problem is formulated. The optimization model not only regards reliability as an independent objective, but also takes the power flow controllers (PFCs) into account. Compared with conventional methods, it overcomes the curse of dimensionality and solves the optimal allocation of PFCs. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II is employed to solve the upper-level problem. For lower-level problems, an algorithm based on minimum spanning trees is proposed to optimally allocate PFCs, and an improved least frequently used cache algorithm and an optimum-test algorithm are developed to promote the computing efficiency of reliability evaluation. The European Supergrid and a Chinese ultra-HVdc system are adopted as test systems to validate the proposed method. Case studies prove that the proposed method provides an effective tool for the planning of HVdc grids. Also, results show that the cache technique and the optimum-test algorithm can reduce more than 70% of the total elapsed time.},

  abstract={This paper presents a mixed-integer linear robust multiobjective model for the expansion planning of an electric power system. An information-gap decision theory-based framework is proposed to take into account the uncertainties in electrical demand and new power system elements prices. The model is intended to increase the power system resistance against the uncertainties caused by forecast errors. The normal boundary intersection method is used to obtain the Pareto front of the multiobjective problem. Since the planning problem is a large-scale problem, the model is kept linear using the Big M linearization technique that is able to significantly decrease the computational burden. The fuel transportation and availability constraints are taken into account. The model also enables the system planner to build new fuel transportation routes whenever it is necessary. The generating units' retirement is also incorporated into the model, and the simulation results are showed to the advantages of incorporating units' retirement in the power system expansion planning model instead of considering it separately. The proposed multiobjective method is applied to the Garver 6-bus, IEEE 24-bus, and IEEE 118-bus test systems, and the results are compared with the well-known epsilon-constraint method.},

  abstract={Planning of the electric distribution networks is complex and about upgrading the system to satisfy the demand and constraints with the best economic plan. The planning alternatives include the expansion of substations, installing new distributed generation (DG) facilities, upgrading distribution feeders, etc. In the modern networks, distribution planners must gain the confidence of the reversibility of the investment where renewable energy resources (RERs) inject clean and cost-effective electrical power to respond to the rising demand and satisfy environmental standards. This paper is an exhaustive review on the distribution network expansion planning (DEP) including the modelling of DEP (possible objective functions, problem constraints, different horizon time, and problem variables), optimization model (single/multi-objective), the expansion of distributed energy resources (DERs), problem uncertainties, etc. We discuss the requirements of integrated energy district master planning to avoid conflicts between the goal of independence of district planning on energy, e.g. heat and electricity, and that of dependencies on the local electric utilities regarding instant power balance and stability services. Finally, we describe the primary future R&D trends in the field of distribution network planning.},

  abstract={The Electric Vehicle (EV) has become the sustainable alternative to fossil fuel driven automobiles. As a result, a new type of load is being seen on power systems. Hence, provision of an EV charging infrastructure has become a new challenge for power system engineers worldwide. It has been identified that the voltage dependent nature of EV load may lead to voltage instabilities in the system. Furthermore, significant load integration into the distribution system may overload the system components, increase power system losses and may violate system constraints. Despite these factors EV consumers should be provided with convenient and reliable charging facilities. Hence, the identification of a charging infrastructure which satisfies requirements of both the EV customer and the power system is of primary importance. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based approach is considered here for planning of EV charging infrastructure.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of distributed power generation with renewable energy as the core, the proportion of energy storage stations connected to the grid is constantly increasing. The access of a large number of energy storage stations will inevitably affect the voltage level and line flow level of the distribution network. Therefore, by reasonably optimizing the access location and capacity of the energy storage station to ensure that its impact on the distribution network is optimal. On this basis, this article uses a multiobjective optimization method to define the minimum voltage deviation, the optimal transmission line margin, and the minimum network loss as the optimization goals. And the firework algorithm is used to solve the problem, and the best access location and access capacity of the energy storage station are obtained. Finally, the IEEE35 node case is used in MATLAB to carry out the simulation calculation to prove the validity of the conclusion. Therefore, the planning scheme of energy storage station proposed in this article has effective theoretical significance and practical value.},

  abstract={The large-scale integration of wind generation in power systems increases the need for reserve procurement in order to accommodate its highly uncertain nature, a fact that may overshadow its environmental and economic benefits. For this reason, the design of reserve procurement mechanisms should be reconsidered in order to embed resources that are capable of providing reserve services in an economically optimal way. In this study, a joint energy and reserve day-ahead market structure based on two-stage stochastic programming is presented. The developed model incorporates explicitly the participation of demand side resources in the provision of load following reserves. Since a load that incurs a demand reduction may need to recover this energy in other periods, different types of load recovery requirements are modeled. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the risk associated with the decisions of the system operator and to assess the effect of procuring and compensating load reductions, the Conditional Value-at-Risk metric is employed. In order to solve the resulting multi-objective optimization problem, a new approach based on an improved variant of the epsilon-constraint method is adopted. This study demonstrates that the proposed approach to risk management presents conceptual advantages over the commonly used weighted sum method.},

  abstract={Due to the high penetration of renewable energy (RE) connected to power system, it has brought challenges to the consumption and efficient utilization of RE. This paper presents a planning method of RE distributed generations (DGs) in the coupled network to improve RE utilization. Firstly, it analyzes local consumption and power export of DGs in the distribution system, and introduces the DG planning method in the coupled network considering the transmission line construction for power export. Then, the multi-objective optimal configuration model for minimizing the annual total cost is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize the efficient consumption of RE and help enormously promote capacity of power grid to accept DGs, while the economic benefits of the system is enhanced.},

  abstract={Risk of blackouts is more than expected and must be considered in the power system studies. The interest of this paper is to minimize the blackouts risk during minimizing the costs in probabilistic transmission expansion planning (TEP). In this paper, a long-term reliability analysis, which was developed by self-organized criticality theory, is used in a multi-objective optimization to include risk of blackouts in TEP. The objective functions are costs and expected energy not supplied. Also, a new formulation for calculating transmission operating cost as a part of cost function is proposed. The problem is solved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization to find an optimal Pareto set from which the decision-maker can choose the most desirable one, regarding existing budget. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 118-bus test system to investigate its applicability and scalability. The results are compared with security-constrained TEP, which uses famous deterministic criterion known as N-1. The proposed approach produces more efficient plans for suppressing cascading blackouts with less network investment. Moreover, the results provide motivation for considering the risk of cascading blackouts in TEP, which afford substantial saving to society.},

  abstract={This paper presents a two-stage planning methodology for optimal placement of switches and reconfiguration of a network to improve the system reliability and reduce real power losses. The solution is obtained by first determining the placement of additional switches for enhancing system reliability and then choosing the optimal configuration for which the system loss is minimized. The first optimization problem consists of two objectives, which are maximization of the system reliability and minimization of the number of additional switches. This multiobjective problem is solved by Non-Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The optimization problem in the second stage involves variables representing open or closed status of the switches, and the objective is to minimize system real power losses subject to system operating constraints. Repeated power flow calculations are performed by the Open Distribution Simulator Software (OpenDSS). This proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE-123 Node Test System, which is extensively used for distribution system studies.},
